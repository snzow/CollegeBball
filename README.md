# College Basketball Simulation
Hello! This is the very early stages of a college basketball simulation that I am building. I am currently mainly focusing on the simulation engine but I plan to implement high school, recruiting, leagues, national tournament etc. Right now the sim is primarily based around nba stats and frequencies but there is room to change these things easily.
Feel free to clone it and poke around, and send me an email at aodhan.bower@gmail.com if you have anything to say!
